## Hot Keywords

"git book" has 18,100 average monthly searches - I'll use "git book"(18,100) as shorthand notation.  "ruby books"(2,400), "javascript books"(5,400), "scala books"(1,300), "python books"(6,600).

"tutorial" related searches get a lot of traffic.  "git tutorial"(60,500), "ruby tutorial"(14,800), "scala tutorial"(14,800), "python tutorial"(135,000), and "javascript tutorial"(74,000) are examples.

"quiz" related searches get a lot less search volume.  "ruby quiz"(390), "javascript quiz"(2,900), "python quiz"(1,600), and "git quiz"(110) are examples.

"learn" related searches get search volumne that's in between.  "learn ruby"(8,100), "learn javascript"(33,100), "learn python"(60,500), "learn git"(4,400), "learn scala"(3,600).

"practice" keywords get really low search volume.

## Keyword Strategy

The subject#show pages can target the "books", "learn", and "quiz" keywords for now.  In the future, we should look into making pages to target the "tutorial" keyword because these get really high search volume.
