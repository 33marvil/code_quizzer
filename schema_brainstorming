Delete answers.status now that it's been replaced with answers.is_correct.

comments should be deleted and replaced with Disqus

exams.status is either "graded", "cancelled" or NULL and should be updated with boolean fields.  is_graded and is_cancelled should work.

exams.correct_answers, exams.incorrect_answers, exams.unanswered_questions should all be deleted.  This will require more database queries when the visitor hits the "Recent Exams" page, but that shouldn't be a problem.  Double check the performance before making this change.

# I might have meant user_id below, I'll need to double check this one carefully
questions.quiz_id should be deleted.  The field is no longer needed.

quizzes.user_id should be deleted.  The database changes outlined below should be completed first.

topics.user_id should be deleted.


Database changes
Delete everything in the "Caitlin" family (make sure there's a dependent => destroy)
Delete everything in the "books" family
Delete the places of the code that reference "Caitlin" and "Books" (e.g. the Ability class)
Perhaps resurrect the "More programming" page and try to give it some decent content.  Some quizzes were terrible from the start and these should be deleted.  There's no reason to hang on to cruft if it's not needed.
