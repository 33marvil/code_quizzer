answers.status should be a boolean field.  Answers are either correct or incorrect.  Create an is_correct field that can be either true or false.  Create a rake task that populates is_correct with 1 if answers.status = "correct" and 0 if answers.status = "incorrect".  Make sure there aren't any values in answers.status other than "correct" and "incorrect" and then delete answers.status.

comments should be deleted and replaced with Disqus

exams.status is either "graded" or NULL and should be a boolean field.
exams.correct_answers, exams.incorrect_answers, exams.unanswered_questions should all be deleted.  This will require more database queries when the visitor hits the "Recent Exams" page, but that shouldn't be a problem.  Double check the performance before making this change.

questions.quiz_id should be deleted.  The field is no longer needed.

quizzes.user_id should be deleted.  The database changes outlined below should be completed first.

topics.user_id should be deleted.


Database changes
Delete everything in the "Caitlin" family (make sure there's a dependent => destroy)
Delete everything in the "books" family
Perhaps resurrect the "More programming" page and try to give it some decent content.  Some quizzes were terrible from the start and these should be deleted.
