# Importance of Precise Language

Computers and precise and literal and it's important to use precise langauge when talking about programming.  One plus the product of four and three is not the same as one plus four times three.

```javascript
console.log(1 + 4 * 3) // 13
console.log((1 + 4) * 3) // 15
```

In the following example, the variable phone is declared and then assigned to the value "addicted".

```javascript
var phone;
phone = "addicted";
```

Novice programers are tempted to say the variable phone "equals" the value "addicted", but that is not correct.  Variable assignment is completely different than equality comparisons.

```javascript
var butterfly = "pretty"; // variable assignment
42 === 35; // equality comparison
```

In the following statment, 4 and 5 are referred to as operands and + is the operator.

```javascript
console.log(4 + 5);
```

In the following statment, typeof() is the operator and false is the operand.

```javascript
typeof(false);
```

We've taken great care to make the language in this book concise and precise.  Make a concerted effort to study this language and use it exactly.  Exact language will accelerate your learning process.
