# Introduction to Strings

Strings are a JavaScript type to store text values like `"bob"` or `'I like cheese'`.  

Strings can be created with single or double quotes.

```javascript
"this is a string"
```
When a number is surrounded by single or double quotes, it is actually a string!

```javascript
'3'
"4.32"
```

Strings can be combined and this is called string concatenation.

```javascript
console.log("bat" + "man"); // prints "batman" to the console
```
