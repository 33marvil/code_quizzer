#Variable reassignment

The following statement declares the variable `b` and assigns `b` to the value `"hello world"`.

```javascript
var b = "hello world";
```

Variables can be reassigned to other values.  The following statment reassigns the variable `b` to another value `3`.

```javascript
b = 3;
```

Notice that the `var` keyword is not used when the variable is reassigned.  The `var` keyword is only needed when the variable is declared.  After the variable is declared, `var` isn't needed anymore.
