# Introduction to Types

Strings, numbers and booleans are different types in the JavaScript programming language.

```javascript
console.log("cat"); // prints the string "cat" to the console
console.log(false); // prints the boolean value false to the console
console.log(8.76); // prints the number 8.76 to the console
```

The typeof() operator can be used to demonstrate that `true` and `false` are boolean values:

```javascript
typeof(true); // "boolean"
typeof(false); // "boolean"
```

The typeof() operator can also be used with strings:

```javascript
typeof("dmx"); // "string"
```

typeof() is called an operator and "dmx" is referred to as an operand.

Here are some examples of the typeof() operator with numbers:

```javascript
typeof(8); // "number"
typeof(9.99); // "number"
```

Numbers, strings, and booleans are three of the 7 different types in the JavaScript programming language.  The other data types will be introduced in later sections.
