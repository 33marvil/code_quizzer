# Declaring Variables

Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values.

The following statement declares the variable `hello`:

```javascript
var hello;
```

Once variables are declared, they can be assigned to a value:

```javascript
var hello;
hello = "meow";
```

Variables can be declared and assigned in a single line of code:

```javascript
var best_number = 8;
```

The statment above is equivalent to these two statements:

```javascript
var best_number;
best_number = 8;
```
