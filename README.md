# CodeQuizzes

## About the site

[CodeQuizzes](http://codequizzes.com) contains a bunch of programming practice questions on Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Bash, Git... and more!


I created quizzes for myself when I was learning to program and decided to create CodeQuizzes as my first Rails application to share these quizzes with the world.  The site is now used by hundreds of people a day!

## Running CodeQuizzes locally
