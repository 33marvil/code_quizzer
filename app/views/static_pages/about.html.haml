%h2 The mission of this website is to help users learn and retain computer science concepts for the long-run.

%h2 Programming questions have been the best way for me to retain and learn computer science programming concepts.
%p Computer science concepts are very difficult to grasp and remember when they are only visited once.  Drilling the concepts multiple times aids understanding and retention.  

%p I learn best by preparing programming practice quetsions as I read through materials or reflect on lecture notes.  Just writing the questions is a good first step to learning the concepts.  After drilling the questions a few times, I understand almost all the material.  The tests are also great to take a couple of months later to gain long term retention.  I wish I started doing this in college!

%h2 About the creator of this site
%p My name is Matt Powers and I started programming at the age of 26 after completing the CFA examination.  I spent 5 years doing economic consulting at a large corporation, but decided to switch careers and become a computer programmer.  

%p I started making programming practice problems in Summer 2012 and thought it would be nice of me to share these with the world.  As I converted this site from a static HTML page to a Rails app, I realized that it would be even better if users could create their own tests to share with the community.  I hope this site can help you and others learn better! :)
