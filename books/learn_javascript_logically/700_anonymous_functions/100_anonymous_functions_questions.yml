    What does the following code print to the console?

    ```javascript
    var beHappy = function() {
      console.log("just chill");
    }
    ```
    console.log(beHappy);
  answer: |2

    ```javascript
    function() {
      console.log("just chill");
    }
    ```

    The beHappy variable is assigned to a function and it is common to accidentally return a function by forgetting to invoke it.  This is what the console.log statement would look like if the function was invoked.

    ```javascript
    console.log(beHappy());
    ```
